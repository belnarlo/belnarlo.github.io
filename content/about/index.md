## About Me

### Professional Background

I'm a **seasoned Linux system engineer** currently focused on **monitoring** (primarily Zabbix and Grafana) and **automation** (SaltStack, Packer, Terraform). After years of building and maintaining infrastructure, I've developed a particular appreciation for systems that actually work reliably.

**Current Focus Areas:**

- **Monitoring & Observability**: Zabbix, Grafana, custom dashboards
- **Infrastructure Automation**: SaltStack for configuration management
- **Platform Evolution**: Recently moved to Nutanix, reassessing traditional toolchains
- **Homelab Experiments**: Because production is for cowards

## The Homelab

My personal testing ground runs on **Proxmox** and includes:

- **TrueNAS** for storage
- **Plex** and **Jellyfin** for media
- **SaltStack** for automation
- **Zabbix** for monitoring everything
- **HashiCorp Vault** for secrets management
- **Docker** for containerized services
- **Tailscale** for secure networking

It's a place where I can break things safely and learn from the inevitable mistakes.

## Beyond the Terminal

When I'm not staring at config files or deciphering log entries, you'll find me:

- **ðŸŽ¸ Learning guitar** - Recent addition to combat IT burnout
- **ðŸ”§ Building electronics projects** - Currently working on a custom guitar pedal
- **ðŸ“š Continuous learning** - Always exploring new technologies and methodologies

## Why This Blog?

After years of solving problems in isolation, I realized that documenting the journey helps not just future me, but potentially others facing similar challenges. This blog is my attempt to capture:

- **Technical solutions** that actually work in practice
- **Project management approaches** for complex homelab setups
- **Lessons learned** from both successes and spectacular failures
- **Work-life balance** strategies for IT professionals

## I believe in

- **Automation over repetition**
- **Monitoring before problems**
- **Documentation that future-you will thank present-you for**
- **Simple solutions over clever ones**
- **Having hobbies that don't involve computers**
