## Welcome to My Digital Workshop

I'm Timo, a seasoned Linux system engineer from the Netherlans, living in Scotland, passionate about **monitoring**, **automation**, and **infrastructure**. This is where I document my journey through homelabs, professional projects, and the occasional victory over stubborn problems.

### What You'll Find Here

**üè† Homelab Adventures**  
Proxmox virtualization, SaltStack automation, Zabbix monitoring, and the eternal quest to make everything work together seamlessly.

**üîß Professional Insights**  
Real-world experiences with **Zabbix**, **Grafana**, **SaltStack**, **Packer**, and **Terraform**. Plus thoughts on transitioning to Nutanix platforms.

**üé∏ Life Beyond IT**  
Because even system engineers need hobbies - guitar playing, electronics projects, and the art of avoiding burnout.
